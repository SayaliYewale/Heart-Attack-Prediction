# Heart-Attack-Prediction using machine learning algorithm
-It is graphical user interface system which based on Tkinter library.

-Machine learning algorithm = Logistic Regression 

-Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that accomplishes binary classification tasks by predicting the probability of an outcome, event, or observation. The model delivers a binary or dichotomous outcome limited to two possible outcomes: yes/no, 0/1, or true/fals
